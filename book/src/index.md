Pausing, unpausing and seeking are synchronized over the Internet, giving everyone playing the same file in the same virtual room a shared viewing experience.
Use alongside <u>**extremely popular**</u> VoIP software, e.g. Microsoft Teams, Zoom, ICQ or other outdated boomer messengers.

## Where can I get this great product?

Check out the [Download](./downloads.md) page or [build](./building.md) it yourself.

The hottest (daily nightly) releases are available on [Github](https://github.com/sevenautumns/niketsu/). 


## [Features](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/x9w0jh/simple_feature/) (Serious) <img src="./images/run.gif" alt="Running Gopher" height=20> <img src="./images/run.gif" alt="Running Gopher" height=20> <img src="./images/run.gif" alt="Running Gopher" height=20> <img src="./images/run.gif" alt="Running Gopher" height=20> <img src="./images/run.gif" alt="Running Gopher" height=20>

- It is **blazingly** lightweight and **exuberantly** fast. Due to its lack of [consistency](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/kzt42q/moving_forward_like_ereh_every_time_i_code/), everything is somewhat lightweight even if it is not. <img src="./images/glowstick.gif" alt="Glowstick Gopher" height=16>
- It is open source and therefore free. Even if it is bad, it is still [free real estate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/sl3wyq/steal_what_is_stolen/) and definitely [not powered by AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/top/?t=year). <img src="./images/network.svg" alt="Network Gopher" height=16>
- The [support](./support.md) is great. Really. If the devs are not sleeping, working, eating, gaming, or doing basically anything else, they will <u>**rapidly**</u> answer any inquiry. Maybe.
- It is written in Rust and Go. Therefore, unprecedented levels of synergy can be reached. More [diversity](https://i.redd.it/hkg2v5l85od71.png), more [pantyhose](https://i.redd.it/7rnq88ok91k81.jpg), more [stocking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/ok4k3e/when_you_take_off_your_programming_socks_its_all/), more [fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/10xtst5/the_interwebs_gives_me_this_impression_about_rust/).
- It is presumably <u>**extremely**</u> [secure](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/z60qdf/tcp_handshake_chaika_edition/) and cares about  your privacy.
- Compared to rival products, it actually works with network mounts and is completely async. No more freezing of the main window during winter. It is async to an extend where it scares the devs.
- There is more Readwritelocks than necessary. Trust me.
- The code is still [somewhat](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/lwqtsj/switch_statements_never_heard_of_em/) [simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/n2ctvc/dont_you_love_it_when_that_happens/). Feel free to contribute [here](https://github.com/sevenautumns/niketsu/tree/main).
- Great and well prepared [Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/lfcgxy/been_there_ngl/).
- The devs [know what they are doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerAnimemes/comments/ijbykf/maybe_i_should_just_quit/).
- There is a dev that ignores the protected [main branch](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/m12sif/topy2k38_animes_with_cute_girls_doing_cute_things/) and force pushes.
